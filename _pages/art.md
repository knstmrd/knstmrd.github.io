I have several artistic projects/endeavours/hobbies related to music/painting/concept art.

I am a multi-instrumentalist musician and have a few solo projects and artistic collaborations:

* [Kunstmord](http://kunstmord.bandcamp.com/) is my main and most serious musical project (which can probably be classified as "experimental rock", if that has any meaning)

* [The Exotic Sphere](http://theexoticsphere.bandcamp.com/) is my instrumental project with no fixed genre and is an outlet for various musical experimentation, such as algorithmic composition, musique concrete, sound design and so on

* [VUG](http://vuggg.bandcamp.com/) was a short-lived noise rock band in which I played guitar; the only "studio" output of this band is [https://vuggg.bandcamp.com/album/the-infinite-vug](a remix of rehearsal sessions) that I made; we have some live videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsG_rsowsYyEuRsnF3wvrqjvtlSpbCv56)

* [Jomar Kepenko](https://jomarkepenko.bandcamp.com/) was a collaboration with a fine English fellow Aimmar Cair done over the Internet; mostly noisy electronica

I'm also one half of the [GODA New Media Artist Collective](http://godacollective.ru/), the other person being Dmitrii Antropov, who has a PhD in Art Studies. We create various interactive installations using the latest technology, trying to simultaneously subvert how people interact with mundane objects, and place the people into the role of artists. I provide scripting help and sound design. We also did a live noise album with multi-channel sound, using OpenCV to track 4 dice in real-time and manipulate the spatial distribution of sound according to the numbers; you can check out the album [here](https://godacollective.bandcamp.com/album/music-of-chances).

I'm an active participant of the Saint-Petersburg free improvisation scene - in 2016, I graduated from the Saint-Petersburg Sound Museum School of Improvisational Music; and I have taken part in various [Fluxus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluxus) performances (both of scores by renowned Fluxus composers and by young Russian avant-garde musicians), performances of text and graphic scores of modern Russian composers, and also had my own scores performed. Of particular note is a performance of a 3-dimensional version of the famous score ["December 1952"](https://graphicnotation.wordpress.com/2011/03/01/002/) by USA composer Earle Brown - his original concept of the graphical score called for a three-dimensional object, but was not realized because of technical constraints. I created a [Javascript version of the score](https://github.com/knstmrd/3December-1952), viewable and controllable in a browser.

Finally, I am an amateur painter and photographer. My photos and paintings can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/csatsf/), and some photos I took with a film camera are on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/98921768@N08/) (though I've abandoned film photography and no longer upload anything there).
