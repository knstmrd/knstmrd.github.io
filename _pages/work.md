I'm a Ph.D. specializing in non-equilibrium rarefied gas dynamics. I received my Bachelors and Masters degrees at the same department in 2013 and 2015, respectively (scientific supervisor - prof. Kustova E.V.). I defended my PhD thesis in April 2017 (scientific supervisor - prof. Kustova E.V.). My thesis is devoted to the study of non-equilibrium physico-chemical process rates in rarefied gas flows and the investigation of the role of cross-coupling between these processes.

Since November 2023 I've been working at the RWTH Aachen University in the group for Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACOM).

From November 2021 till November 2023 I've worked at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Göttingen on a project sponsored by the Alexander von Humboldt foundation. The research project is concerned with uncertainty quantification of non-equilibrium expanding flows. I am also involved in work on moment method closures for reacting gas flows, photon Monte Carlo radiation modelling, and particle-in-cell DSMC methods for rarefied plasma simulations.

From July 2018 to June 2021 I worked at the University of Texas at Austin, developing new methods for modelling rarefied gas flows. These include hybridizing discrete velocity and DSMC methods; developing variable-weight DSMC schemes, and improving modelling of tail-driven processes.

From 2013 to the end of 2017 I was employed as an assistant researcher and research engineer at the Department of Hydroaeromechanics of the Saint-Petersburg State University, where I've worked on implementation of various kinetic theory algorithms in code.

From 2016 to 2018, I was one of the lead developers of the KAPPA library (located at the other lead developer's [GitHub page](https://github.com/lkampoli/kappa)) designed for calculation of thermodynamic and transport properties in arbitrary mixtures of gases with ionization and electronic excitation in the state-to-state, multi-temperature and one-temperature approaches. The library is aimed at being used in conjunction with CFD solvers, to allow for the coupling of CFD code with well-tested and accurate kinetic theory algorithms for computation of transport coefficients and the most accurate models of non-equilibrium process rates.

During my employment at SPSU, I've had 3 internships - at the German Aerospace Agency, also known as the DLR (Göttingen, Germany, 2017); at the Federal University of Parana (Curitiba, Brazil, 2016); at the Khristianovich Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (Novosibirsk, Russia, 2016).

In my day-to-day work, I utilize Python, C++, C, Julia and Fortran, and I'm well acquainted with various numerical libraries for both languages: Armadillo, GSL and Boost for C++, Numpy (and Numba) and Scipy for Python.
I also have experience in Direct Simulation Monte Carlo methods, Discrete Velocity methods and working with CFD solvers.

During my spare time, I work on various machine learning/data analysis tasks. I have participated in multiple Kaggle competitions, and have a large experience working with different machine learning and data processing tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Catboost, LightGBM, as well experience with deep learning (PyTorch, Keras). I also have some basic knowledge of Spark and Vowpal Wabbit.

My other code-related hobby is audio processing. I have experience with MAX/MSP and have implemented some sound-processing algorithms in it; I also have written a minimal DSP library in C++, based on the Armadillo linear algebra library. I am also acquainted with audio processing toolkits such as Librosa, YAAFE and Essentia.

Other miscellaneous knowledge I have: I have some very basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development, having worked on a few basic sound generation app projects that used AudioKit and SpriteKit. In 2013-2014 I've also worked as a freelance web designer and have created various online Javascript games, and gained some Django and related framework experience, as well as some knowledge of CSS and HTML.
