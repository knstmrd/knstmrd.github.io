I'm a Ph.D. specializing in non-equilibrium rarefied gas dynamics. I received my Bachelors and Masters degrees at the same department in 2013 and 2015, respectively (scientific supervisor - prof. Kustova E.V.). I defended my PhD thesis in April 2017 (scientific supervisor - prof. Kustova E.V.). My thesis is devoted to the study of non-equilibrium physico-chemical process rates in rarefied gas flows and the investigation of the role of cross-coupling between these processes.

From 2013 to the end of 2017 I worked as an assistant researcher and research engineer currently at the Department of Hydroaeromechanics of the Saint-Petersburg State University, where I've implemented various kinetic theory algorithms in code.
Since 2016, I've been the lead developer of the KAPPA library designed for calculation of thermodynamic and transport properties in arbitrary mixtures of gases with ionization and electronic excitation in the state-to-state, multi-temperature and one-temperature approaches. The library is aimed at being used in conjunction with CFD solvers, to allow for the coupling of CFD code with well-tested and accurate kinetic theory algorithms for computation of transport coefficients and the most accurate models of non-equilibrium process rates.
During that period, I've had 3 internships - at the German Aerospace Agency, also known as the DLR (GÃ¶ttingen, Germany); at the Federal University of Parana (Curitiba, Brazil); at the Khristianovich Institute of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (Novosibirsk, Russia).

In my day-to-day work, I utilize both C++ and Python, and I'm well acquainted with various numerical libraries for both languages: Armadillo, GSL and Boost for C++, Numpy (and Numba) and Scipy for Python.
I have had also some experience with Direct Simulation Monte Carlo methods and working with CFD solvers.

During my spare time, I work on various machine learning/data analysis tasks. I have participated in 8 Kaggle competitions, and have experience with different machine learning tools: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Catboost, Keras, Nolearn. I also have some basic knowledge of Spark (which I have not applied to any real-life problems yet, though).

My other code-related hobby is audio processing. I have experience with MAX/MSP and have implemented some sound-processing algorithms (such as a reverb) in it; I also have written a C++ DSP library based on the Armadillo linear algebra library, which implements a basic set of FIR and IIR filters, as well as STFT and other helpful algorithms. I'm currently working on a machine learning-based raw audio generation code.

Other miscellaneous knowledge I have: I have some basic knowledge of Swift and iOS development, having worked on a few basic sound generation app projects that used AudioKit and SpriteKit. In 2013-2014 I've also worked as a freelance web designer and have created various online Javascript games, and gained some Django and related framework experience, as well as some knowledge of CSS and HTML.
